##Steps to host community meeting:

Create a new hackmd page copying contents from [this template](https://hackmd.io/pbVbAxgRT1-VSKjM2K0HzA?both).

Check who is ready for giving the 5 minute flash talk.

Edit the values such as date, CFP update, flash talk, metrics, and other such things in the template

Send out a invite to gluster-devel and gluster-users list by mentioning the following:

        Bridge: https://bluejeans.com/836554017

        Minutes meeting: {link to the new hackmd created by copying the template}

        Previous Meeting notes: https://github.com/gluster/community/meetings

        Flash talk: {who is giving it and what it is about}

When the meeting starts, we need to update the hackmd with the minutes. Suggested get someone for doing this atleast once the meeting starts.

Go through the items in the template one after the another.

We have to decide the host for the next meeting.

Once that is done, the minutes of the meeting have to be created as a {date}-Community-meeting.md file inside the meeting directory of the gluster/community project and a pushed across to the repo.
Once pushed to the repo, the minutes of the meeting have to be sent to the gluster-users and gluster-devel. (make sure the content is copy pasted rather than providing a link)
